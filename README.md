# **Genomic Knowledge RAG System**

## **Executive Summary**

The **Genomic Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System** is an advanced AI-powered platform designed to answer genomic queries with high accuracy. This project integrates **AWS Bedrock, FAISS, and BERT** to provide precise mutation-related insights. A logistic regression model ranks retrieved results based on relevance, and evaluation metrics such as BLEU and Exact Match ensure high-quality responses. The system is deployed on AWS with **Terraform for infrastructure automation** and follows strict **security protocols** for genomic data handling.

## **2. Data Pipeline & Preprocessing**

### **2.1 Dataset Structure**

The genomic dataset includes structured mutation information with the following columns:

- `Mutation_ID`: Unique identifier for each mutation.
- `Gene`: Name of the gene where the mutation occurs.
- `Mutation_Type`: Type of mutation (e.g., SNP, deletion, insertion).
- `Clinical_Impact`: Predicted impact on gene function.
- `PubMed_References`: Scientific literature references.

### **2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Performed **statistical analysis** and **visualization** to:

- Identify missing values and inconsistencies.
- Analyze mutation frequency distribution.
- Perform **PCA for dimensionality reduction**.
- Generate **word clouds for mutation descriptions**.

### **2.3 Data Storage**
